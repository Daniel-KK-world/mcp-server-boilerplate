app/tools.py

This file is the entry point for registering your custom MCP tools.

How to use:
- Define your tool functions here or import them from app/tools/ modules.
- Register each tool using the @mcp.tool() decorator.
- See the example template below for guidance.

To add a new tool:
1. Define an async function that implements your tool's logic.
2. Decorate it with @mcp.tool().
3. Return a result (dict, str, etc.) that will be sent to the MCP client.

For more advanced tools, organize them as classes in app/tools/ and import/register them here.
